# Backbone Bridge
----

Backbone Bridge is a one-to-one mapper for users migrating from [BackboneJS](http://backbonejs.org/) to 
[CanJS](http://canjs.us/).  No code changes!

## Why!?

Why would you wanna upgrade? CanJS offers:

- Faster Performance
- Richer Feature set
- Lighter-weight download


## How?

You just drop in _bridge.js_, remove Backbone from your application, add CanJS and now all your code is running
on CanJS without any syntax changes.
